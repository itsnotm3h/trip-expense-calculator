## Overview
The system allows users to log expenses, modify existing entries, and generate expense summaries. It’s designed to be a command-line interface application for beginners to practice basic Java programming concepts.

## Key Features

### Basic Features
- **Add Expense**: Users can log a new expense by entering the item name, amount, currency, and payment method.
- **Edit Expense**: Modify an existing expense.
- **Delete Expense**: Remove an expense.
- **View Summary**: Generate a summary of all expenses, either by individual or for the entire trip.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for this application.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The IDE used for developing, testing, and debugging the application.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The application runs entirely in the command-line interface, providing a simple user experience.

## What I Learned
This project has been a valuable learning experience. Here’s what I’ve learned so far:
- **Java Basics**: I’ve become more familiar with Java syntax, including data types, operators, and flow control.
- **User Input Handling**: I learned how to take user input through the command line and process it correctly using `Scanner`.
- **Arrays and Lists**: I practiced using arrays and ArrayLists to store and manage data, such as expenses, in memory.
- **Error Handling**: I learned the importance of validating inputs and handling errors gracefully, ensuring the program doesn't crash from unexpected inputs.
